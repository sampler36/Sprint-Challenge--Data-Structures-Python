Add your answers to the questions below.
O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.
O(N) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `append` method?
O(1) using the array data structure

2. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `append` function?
and for the space it will be O(n) since we inserting in an array

3. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?
 O(n)

4. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?
O(n)

5. What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
O(n)

6. What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
O(n)

7. What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
O(n log n) merging 2 sets then comparing them

8. What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
O(n) when the best case for a merge is O(n log n) then for the space it would be O(n)
