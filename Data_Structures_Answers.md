Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `append` method?
i did the insertion sort like so basically thats  O(n)
for an array but there is an if statement might be O(1)

2. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `append` function?
and for the space it will be O(n) since we inserting in an array

3. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?
 O(n)

4. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?
O(n)

5. What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
O()

6. What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?


7. What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
O(n log n) merging 2 sets then comparing them

8. What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
O(n) when the best case for a merge is O(n log n) then for the space it would be O(n)
